# MyReads

## Project Overview:

For the **My Reads** projects, we have to create a bookshelf app that allows us to select and categorize books we have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

### Project Rubric

The project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [MyReads project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view).

### How to run this website?

1. Go to the project folder, Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
2. Run npm start - this runs the server.
2. With the server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
